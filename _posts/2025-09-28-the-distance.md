## Introduction

The same dark room. It’s been 3-4 days and I’m not even realizing when the sun comes up or when it goes down. In this 1RK room with closed windows, I can’t even tell when it’s day or when it’s night. Lying on the same bed when I’m hungry, I eat something and then it’s the same: either holding the laptop and doing work, or watching useless, meaningless videos on YouTube. Or I’m listening to stories, constantly wanting to fill my head with noise, because I’m scared of silence now. Because if I stop the outside noise, I’ll hear something... my internal voice...

Then finally, I was so fed up that I gave my phone to my friend who lives beside my house. I cooked some food, and while eating, halfway through, tears started rolling down.

When you’re all alone, with no one around to console you... and you know you still have to eat for the sake of your health... you still have to clean the utensils because no one else will... you can’t leave your room messy because a messy room takes you to the worst mental state (and I absolutely hate messy rooms)... so I kept doing everything, while crying.

Maybe in that moment, I wanted to cry. Cry my heart out. Cry until I fell asleep. Maybe I needed it.

## Why?

I keep asking myself this question - why? Why am I feeling like this? Why am I stuck? Why does everything feel heavy even when nothing is actually wrong?
And when I finally tried to share this with someone, he replied:
_“You’re so privileged. You just got a new MacBook. If I had that, I wouldn’t just code, I would breathe code. You just lack discipline and consistency.”_ Well… thanks, I guess.

Because I know that... I know I lack discipline. I know I’m inconsistent. I know I’m not doing what I’m supposed to be doing. But even when I work all day, I feel horrible, and when I don’t work at all, I feel horrible too. It’s very lonely here.

_(I’ve finally realized that remote work isn’t that great, especially when you live alone and you’re so introverted that you don’t even know how to step out of your own shell. Those three months of working from the office were way better than sitting in this tiny room all day, with nowhere to go and no one to talk to.)_

Honestly, loneliness isn’t new to me. In my 20 years of life, I’ve pretty much always been alone. But this time… it feels different. Maybe because I’m in a different city now, 12 hours away from my hometown. Maybe because now I’m the one responsible for keeping myself sane. And I don’t know if what I’m feeling is just loneliness, or utter disappointment in myself, or fear of what’s ahead.

All I know is, I’m not the person I used to be anymore. That version of me who believed, “I can be anything, I can have anything”, she’s fading. Is this what adulthood really is? Loneliness wrapped in responsibility?

## Does the change need to be external or internal?

Mom being Mom, even without me saying anything, sensed something in my voice. Maybe she heard the sadness I was trying to hide. And before I could even process it, she had already booked my tickets to come home. (Of course, me being the usual asshole, I threw a fit about it, _“How can you book tickets without asking me first?”_) But still... I went.

Did it help? Did I feel better?

Honestly… no.

Because this house is even more silent than my place in Bhubaneswar. At least there, I could hear traffic, people, life happening somewhere. Here, it’s just walls and silence. Mom went to work. Dad went to work. And once again I was alone. Stuck in the silence of a dark house.

So I asked myself - _"Even if they were here, would it change anything?"_
Because I once read in How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie:

> “It’s not where you are... Because no matter where you go, you take yourself with you.”

And maybe... that’s it.
Maybe the problem isn't where I stay, but who I am.

It’s me who dislikes everything about myself: my health, my looks, my financial situation, my terrible sleeping habits, my unhealthy eating habits... even my loneliness.

But what am I doing about it? Except worrying? Complaining?

Maybe it is true, God helps those who help themselves.
Maybe no change of city or people will matter unless something changes inside me first.

## Okay, what's next?

No idea, bro. But I know one thing, I can't sit here anymore complaining. I’ve been doing that for a long while and it didn’t take me anywhere for sure. Maybe we don't take action because we fear the worst, but I learned somewhere:

> "When you let fear control your life, you end up at a place that's worse than what you were trying to avoid."

So fine, if I need to start somewhere, then let’s start with this: stop trying to fill my surroundings with external noise. And maybe start appreciating being alone, not calling it loneliness but **_solitude_**. And instead of stopping my internal voice from spilling facts at me, I should actually hear it and take decisions wisely.

So basically, when I’m feeling sad, instead of trying to forget things through stories or scrolling my phone, maybe it’s better to confront it. Somewhere or somehow, this overstimulation, this over-availability of information, constantly seeing how people are getting ahead in life while yours sucks... that’s probably the main reason behind all this stress, jealousy, lack of patience, and impulsive behaviour.

I know it’s nowhere easy because I’ve tried many times, but just like an alcoholic who keeps going back to alcohol, I keep wasting my time and energy on my phone. (_Guys, is it just me or is this the problem of the entire generation?_)

But fine. Tried many times, will try again this time too. Because I seriously don’t feel like staying in this mental state any longer or making it even worse.

And maybe I can start with something as simple as sleeping properly, which might solve half my problems, from my falling hair that’s bothering me, to reducing stress, to improving efficiency in work and studies, to getting rid of these dark circles under my eyes that are making me look like Dracula.

## Conclusion? I guess...

I know this time I need to have patience. Honestly, I don’t even know why I wrote this blog. I just... wanted to write something. My friend told me, “Write how your life sucks, you were babbling about it last night anyway.” And I thought, yeah, why eat someone else’s brain when I can dump it here instead.

I don’t have any expectations that anyone will actually read this. But bro, if you are reading it - congratulations 👏, you just wasted your time because there’s not a single line of motivation here.

Anyway, I’m still hopeful, thanks to one of my favorite books, “One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way” by Robert Maurer. So maybe this tiny decision of sleeping properly and reducing unnecessary information consumption might bring some positive change. If not immediately, then at least after a month. (_Though okay, good sleep does show results the very next day, that’s the only reason I’m choosing it. I don’t have the patience to wait a month for results._)

So bye. Hopefully, the next time I write a blog on this topic, it won’t be me babbling about how everything sucks, but something better.
