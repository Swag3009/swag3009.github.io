# Introduction
This internship journey began during a time when I was drowning in self-doubt, defeat, and a sense of purposelessness. My first semester of MCA at VSSUT had just ended, and by mid second semester, around February 2025, I was feeling hopeless.

In that duration, a message popped up in our college TNP WhatsApp group. A company from Bhubaneswar was conducting interviews for a summer internship at OUTR. The tech stack they were looking for? JavaScript, React, and optionally Ruby on Rails. At the time, I was so mentally checked out that I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But seeing familiar tech in the requirements, I applied. And guess where I filled out the form? In the bathroom. Yep, the hostel washroom. (Don‚Äôt judge, everyone scrolls their phone there!)

Of course, my CV wasn‚Äôt even ready. I had already received several emails asking for it, and I still hadn‚Äôt uploaded it. When a few friends told me they were planning to go to Bhubaneswar for the interview, I debated whether I should join. Deep down, I believed there was no way I‚Äôd crack it, no DSA prep, and the entire first year of MCA had been more about dealing with depression than studying.

But the night before the trip, I had a moment of clarity:
***"What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? I won‚Äôt get selected? Fine. At least I‚Äôll get interview experience‚Ä¶ and maybe a good day roaming around Bhubaneswar."***

So I took the chance.
Packed my bag.
And yes, believe it or not, I left for the interview without a laptop.

# Interview

## Mindset
When I reached Bhubaneswar the day before the interview, I was mentally prepared to get knocked out in the very first DSA round. I had zero expectations of making it through that part. But deep down, I had this quiet confidence that if I somehow reached the interview stage, I‚Äôd do well. Why? Because, well my communication skills are okay. Okay, let‚Äôs not be very humble, they‚Äôre actually pretty good.

A few weeks earlier, I had taken part in a soft skills program where I learned a lot about how to carry myself, things like appearance, body language, and vocal tonality. That gave me an extra edge. Plus, even though I hadn‚Äôt been productive for most of my first year in MCA, I did have a 5-month internship experience behind me. And I made sure to understand the basics of JavaScript really well.

But still, since I had already assumed I‚Äôd be out after the DSA round, I didn‚Äôt bother to prepare for it. No brushing up, no problem solving drills, nothing. I went in with the mindset: ***‚ÄúWhatever happens, happens.‚Äù***

## Day of Interview
When we reached Bhubaneswar, we found out, we were supposed to bring our own laptops. And guess what? I hadn‚Äôt brought mine. But by some stroke of luck, the friend I was traveling with had some amazing connections. Not only did her friends help us find a place to stay, but they also arranged laptops for us. I‚Äôm genuinely grateful especially to my friend for sorting one out for me too.

The next morning, we woke up around 6 AM, booked an Uber, and set off, ready to let fate take its course.

### Pre-Placement Talk
Around 10 AM, the pre-placement talk began. It was delivered by none other than the CEO Suman Ranjan Panda. When he stepped on stage and introduced himself, I was honestly surprised. I didn‚Äôt expect someone so young, so grounded, and so humble to be leading a company. But the real surprise came as he spoke.

Everything he said about the company, the work culture, the expectations, the hunger for growth, resonated deeply with me. He spoke about being workaholic, giving your all to learning and building, being passionate, and dreaming of leadership. He talked about things like blogging, open source contributions, and startup life. Each word felt like it was directly connected to the goals I had buried inside me.

That talk flipped a switch. I said: ‚ÄúGod, I want this. I‚Äôm going to give it my 100%.‚Äù

In that moment, I just knew, this was where I could grow. I could learn not just tech, but real-world discipline, mindset, and purpose. I instantly decided that if I didn't make it through the round, I‚Äôd still reach out to him on LinkedIn.

I knew that from this man I can learn a lot, and I indeed learnt a lot from him in future.

### DSA Round
Finally, it was time for DSA Round. It had two parts: one DSA problem-solving round and the second, an MCQ round, each lasting 60 minutes.

I spent the entire first hour stuck on one coding question‚Ä¶ and even then, I could only pass two test cases. The MCQ round wasn‚Äôt great either. The people I knew, who practiced DSA regularly must‚Äôve done way better. They were disciplined, consistent, and sharp. That was far from my reality.

But once we all walked out of the exam hall, I started hearing the same thing from others too. Turns out, while the questions were fairly easy, many struggled to solve them in JavaScript. Most were used to practicing in other languages.

While some friends, disappointed, started planning to head out and make the most of the remaining, my intuition told me to wait until the result is out.

Just as I sat down to finally grab a bite (fun fact: I didn't have food that day till 10 PM, busy all day giving interview), my phone buzzed with the result message. My heart started racing. Scrolling through the list of selected names, I braced myself‚Ä¶
And then‚Äî
There it was.
‚ÄúSwagatika Mohapatra.‚Äù

My mind started running fast with excitement and panic, I cancelled my food order immediately, rushed to get photocopies of my documents (which, by the way, were never used, and I wasted ‚Çπ150 in the process), and sprinted back to the college for the next round.

### Interview Round 1
While preparing for Round 2 and my first interview, the first guy from our class was called in. After studying nearly a year in college, I didn‚Äôt even know of his existence, let alone his name, and I felt too awkward to ask how his interview went or what questions were being asked. (Later, our bond grew so well that I now consider him a brother, with full bro code üòâ.)

I practiced all the important questions that could be asked, promises, async operations, closures, etc. The first round was virtual and went well. I was asked to write code on the exact concept I had revised just 5 minutes before. I did struggle a bit with a React state management question since it had been over 8 months since I last looked at React code. But I told myself, "You know this, you just don‚Äôt remember the syntax. Focus, and you‚Äôll crack it." The interviewer asked me to use Google, but I said I‚Äôd try on my own. With a few hints from him, I made it functional. I thought it went well and was expecting the next round.

### Interview Round 2
In this round, I was asked about my projects. And all I could think was, I had done an internship in React Native, but the project was private and on my old GitHub account. My current GitHub had no React Native projects. I was sure they‚Äôd think I was lying. And in my resume, being the stupidest person in the world, I hadn‚Äôt added links to any of my projects. I had added a link to my blog website. It had an unprofessional photo, some immature blogs, and luckily, a link to my GitHub. But even then, the projects listed there weren‚Äôt anything impressive.

The blog site had an unprofessional photo, immature blogs, and luckily, a link to my GitHub. But still, my projects weren‚Äôt impressive. The blog was built using a Jekyll GitHub template, but the interviewer thought I had made it from scratch. He started asking how I created it. I explained that I used a Jekyll template and write my blogs using Emacs org-mode (trying to show off that I knew Emacs and was cool). He said he was a Vim user and moved on.

He gave me a question to solve and asked some React questions, like what is Virtual DOM, React Navigation, etc. I solved the coding question since it was similar to the one from the last round. But I couldn‚Äôt answer some of the React questions properly.

And wait, you don‚Äôt know the blunder I made.

Out of nervousness, panic, and my desperate attempt to show that I *‚Äúknew things‚Äù* I kept interrupting the interviewer. Later, I was told I had made an impression of being impatient, overconfident, and not ideal for teamwork.

### HR Round
It was already late by the time my round 2 was over, maybe 8 o'clock. And I was waiting to know if I was selected for the next round.

After a long wait, I was told that I was selected for the HR round, and it was in person, taken by Suman Ranjan Panda. (Okay, now finally I can use my soft skill program knowledge.) I went in with a mild smile, covering my nervousness with confidence (which later was told as overconfidence), keeping my body straight, taking care of my hand movements.

At first, he asked me some normal questions, about me, my hobbies, education, then he asked me some critical thinking questions about how to handle a certain situation. And then finally, I was asked to draw a simple database system and write a query for it. God knows what I wrote (I was cursing myself, *"Swagatika, at least you could‚Äôve studied this subject properly in class"*). But anyway, I came out of the interview without any confidence, but with some hope of a miracle.

Oh, yeah, I haven't told you the blunders I made again. In my CV, being the stupid person I am, I wrote the year of my B.Sc. passing as 2029. And again, I was also interrupting the CEO of the company while he was talking. Like seriously, can you believe it?

# The Result
We were told that we would get our results on Saturday or Sunday. But even after Sunday passed without any announcement, I messaged Suman on LinkedIn, expressing my interest in working at his company. I also sent him my previous internship certificate, a referral email screenshot, and an updated resume. I mentioned that I wished to join as a React Native intern.

I didn‚Äôt get any reply.

Then on Monday, while I was sitting in the library, a BTech girl,  whom I recognized from the soft skills program, came up to me and congratulated me. Completely flabbergasted, I asked her why. She said, ‚ÄúYou got selected for the company!‚Äù.

But wait, I also got a message from Suman requesting a meeting.

After two cancellations, the third time, the meeting finally happened. He explained that he wanted to speak with me because he had doubts about taking me in. He had noticed some behavioral issues, like impatience, poor listening skills, and was unsure if I can work with a team. But since I accepted my faults sincerely, he decided to give me a chance.

And hurray, I got the summer internship! ü•≥

My first internship interview (offline, of course). I cracked it, from seeming impossible to becoming reality.

# Internship
## Pre Internship Duration
Before we start our intership, we were expected to complete HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React from BigBinary Accademy, and one assessment supposed to happen before we join the office. But me being me, I neglected completing it, but I completed till the theory part of JavaScript, and missing some main exercise parts, and because our exams used to get complete soon, we joined office on 12 May, before our assessment, the first day of us in office, we were supposed to give javascript assessment. And all of from vssut failed. (I realized I'm not the only one who neglected). Then we took another 5 days to practice the exercises, and I passed the assessment the next time.

Then it was time for the React course, and me not realising the importance of deadline, wasted 3-4 days, on emacs configuration for react, because my dual booted old system, couldn't work with VS Code. Because of which I missed my first deadline. And then the office provided us laptop. And I worked day and night to complete my deadline. When I say day and night, then it is sleeping only 3-4 hours in a day, and working the remaining time. And the fact is, my parents came from a 12 hour of journey to meet me on Thursday. Then the time come for project completion. And because of short of time, and always being exhausted, I didn't read the chapters properly, and somehow managed it on time. But then that caused trouble on my assessment which was a project I was supposed to made using best practices. There again I struggled, again the same loop of working day and night, getting stucked into problems, and when asking my mentor, she getting frustrated with me mentioning I don't read the instructions properly and didn't go through the chapters properly. I was so much into coding all the time, that when my parents came to meet me after 12 hour of journey on saturday, I didn't meet them until sunday 1 pm, the day they were leaving back to home and 6 pm. Obviously I felt terrible at that moment, because I couldn't even spend time with them properly being sleepy all the night, because last 2 days I didn't sleep more then 3 hrs per day, and last 7 days sleeping 4-5 hrs of day.

And I was told that, I don't take the deadlines seriously, and make excuses just before deadline. And that sentence took a such troll in my mind and demotivated truely. And started thinking, something is wrong with me, that people working less, get done with things so well, and me taking so much stress, and sacrifising even my health
