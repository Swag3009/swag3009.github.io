## Introduction

Lately, I find myself feeling both grateful to and frustrated with AI. It has made my life easier but also, in some ways, more miserable. Have you ever felt like AI is slowly making you dumber? Day by day? A little lazier? Like it’s quietly stealing your ability to think? That sounds harsh, I know... but be honest, doesn’t it feel true sometimes? I barely try to remember things anymore. I don’t even bother Googling and reading through blogs like I used to. Why would I, when I can just ask AI, get an instant answer, read it once, and forget it the next moment? Everything is fast, effortless and maybe a little too comfortable. And if you’re an introvert like me, this part might hit harder. It’s so much easier to talk to AI than to a real person. AI always knows what to say. It validates your emotions, understands your pain, and never misunderstands you. And honestly? That’s the scary part.

In this blog, I’ll be doing a self-analysis: how much AI is truly helping me, and how much it might be slowly pulling me toward destruction. Stick with me throughout this journey.

- Let Them Go

In this world, all things must fade,
Every bond that’s ever made.
Life’s a train that never stays,
It moves along through nights and days.

Some sit with you for just a while,
Share your tears, your hopes, your smile.
Then they leave when time says so,
And still the train must always go.

The train never begs hearts to stay,
So why do you, in silent pain, pray?
Why cling to souls meant to roam?
Breathe deep now let them go.

I know the urge to make him stay,
To beg one more night, one more day.
The thought of him not by your side
Haunts your heart you try to hide.

The distance burns, the goodbye too,
But he says, “I need to go.”
So listen once, and let him be,
Love sometimes means setting free.

You want to ask him, “Wait for me,
Just minutes more, can’t you see?”
But when he turns and won’t hear you,
Hold your storm say nothing too.

If he chooses to walk away,
Don’t block his path, don’t beg him stay.
It’s hard, I know, but set apart
This aching weight upon your heart.

No bitterness, no heavy blame,
No burning rage, no whispered shame.
Just smile soft and wish him well,
Be proud of love you couldn’t sell.

Be happy for his road ahead,
For dreams he’ll chase, the life he’s led.
With quiet grace and courage grown,
Let him walk his path alone.

Don’t think once, don’t think again,
Don’t count the loss, don’t measure pain.
When someone cuts the ties you knew,
When your presence feels untrue

Let them go without a fight,
Even if your love was right.
If your staying dims their light,
Release them into their flight.

Don’t cry in rooms they’ll never see,
Don’t wish for “someday, maybe, we.”
When they choose a life apart,
Smile and gently free your heart.

Cut the ties with warmth, not cold,
With quiet strength and courage bold.
Wish them joy, no bitter scar,
Bless them where they are.

It’s not just letting bodies part,
It’s healing slowly, piece by part.
It’s making peace with empty space,
And loving life at your own pace.

It’s being glad for them, for you,
For paths that split, yet still feel true.
It’s learning how to softly know:
Some hearts stay
and some must go.

```

The poem sounds good, doesn’t it?
But here’s the thing, I didn’t write it. It’s just what I wanted to say, not what I actually wrote.

This is what I wrote instead...

- The Art of Letting Go

In this world, everything has some time limit for their existence
And your life is like a train
Some people sit on the train, and go away when their destination comes
The train never attach itself with it’s passengers
Why are you attaching yourself with the people and things in your life
Let it go
I can understand the urge you are feeling to stop
Stop that one person from going
The idea of him not there for you, haunts you
The distance is painful
But he is saying “I want to go.”
Hence let him go
I know you want to ask him to stop,
Ask him to say wait for one more day
For some more minutes
The bye is hurting you
But let him go
When he doesn’t want to listen, don’t tell him the hurricane inside you
When he wants to walk away let him
I know it’s hard but free yourself
From this hurtful attachment
And let him go
No bitter feelings, not resentment
Simply smile, wish him the best
Be happy for the new journey he is beginning
Happily let him go
Don’t think for a second, don’t think for a moment
Don’t think twice
When someone wants to cut the ties with you
When someone don’t want your presence in their life
When you mean nothing to them anymore
Let them go
Even if you mean a lot to them,
But you are stopping them from their happy life
If your presence starts making them feel like a burden for their growth
Let them go
Don’t cry, don’t feel bad, don’t miss,
Don’t secretly wish to meet them once again in your life time
When they want to go
Smiling cut all the ties, feel a warmth of happiness
Wishing the best, without having any bitter feelings
Just let them go….
It’s not about letting them go physically
It’s about  being fine with the fact that they are not there
It’s about making peace with fact
It’s about being happy for them and yourself
It’s about being okay, for letting them go who doesn’t want to be with you
It’s about letting them go form your heart.

I don’t really know how to write poems or even a good essay in English. My writing is full of mistakes: spelling mistakes, grammatical mistakes, all of it. And when your schooling is done in a local language as in my case, Odia medium till 10th grade it adds another layer of insecurity. We even studied science in Odia, with Odia terminology. So yes, when it comes to English, I carry a very real insecurity.

Somehow, over time, I managed to become confident in spoken English still with mistakes, of course. But writing in English? That’s still a nightmare for me.

Despite all this, I’ve always wanted to express my emotions through writing. I used to write diaries unsent letters to God, and to people I never had the courage to talk to. When I first learned about blogging, I knew I wanted to write my own blogs someday. But then, as always, my insecurities would creep back in.
And this is where AI became a saviour. With AI, I can share my emotions freely without worrying about silly grammatical mistakes or awkward sentences. I write my thoughts section by section, and then ask AI to help me structure them better. It helps me write reports, theses, applications, and even emails I need to send to my boss or clients.
And honestly? That feels empowering.
But like any technology, AI has both a good side and a bad side. The key is to be the master of AI not its slave. Easy to say, right? Let me explain where that thin line really is and how easily you can cross into the danger zone without even realizing it.

## The Thin Line

Let’s say I’m not writing the content at all. I’m not choosing the topic, not taking inspiration from the real world, not even thinking. I simply ask AI to find a topic, write about it, and post it with zero human contribution. No brain involved at all. So basically, you’re reading something that is 100 percent AI-generated. And this is already a reality. A huge portion of the content out there, maybe 70 percent, is now AI-written or AI-assisted. The scary part? AI has this tendency to tell you what you want to hear and show you what you want to see. And that becomes extremely dangerous when it starts reducing your tolerance for ideas that lie outside your comfort zone or understanding.

Once, I spoke to someone who said creativity is nothing but permutation and combination, something AI can easily replicate. Really? Does that mean everything will now be AI-generated? No human mind involved? No originality left, the very thing we keep talking about? Will real poets, who pour their creativity, experiences, and knowledge into beautiful poems, be replaced by AI-generated verses? Will literature itself be replaced by algorithms? Will the beautiful art created by painters be replaced by machine-generated images?

Now think about this from a student’s perspective. Constantly relying on AI to write your thesis or records, without having any real idea of what you’re even writing. Not understanding the topic. Asking AI not only to generate your presentation but also to decide what topic you’re going to present. At that point, AI isn’t just helping you, it’s instructing you. It’s deciding what you will think and talk about.

And the worst part? You’re willingly becoming a slave while believing you’re the master. Just change the prompt, and suddenly AI decides who’s in control.

And if you know anything about neuroplasticity, you know this: to learn something new, master a skill, or create something meaningful, you need to think, ponder, and struggle. That struggle matters. But today, our patience to dig deep into a topic is fading. Instead of searching, reading blogs, and sitting with confusion to truly understand something, we simply ask AI to give us all the answers. Learning requires effort, real effort, and that effort demands focus and discipline. Yet now, our mind says, If AI is going to do the work for me anyway, why should I waste my energy? So the real question becomes: what are you doing with that saved time? Are you improving a skill AI can’t replace? Are you doing something better than AI? Or are you just slacking off, scrolling endlessly and wasting time doing nothing?

If I talk about myself, these days, I don’t start working until deadlines hit. At the last moment, I deliver work using AI, barely coding anything on my own. This behavior is slowly eating away my self-confidence. Deep down, I know it’s not really my work. I don’t fully understand it. And if you become this kind of person, then yes, you become highly replaceable.

## So What’s the Solution?

Maybe the solution isn’t to stop using AI. It’s to not let AI replace your thinking, understanding, decision-making, experimentation, focus, and patience. In fact, it’s more important than ever to work on these skills deliberately.

Using AI for repetitive tasks is incredibly valuable. But when you ask it to do everything for you without understanding the task itself, it’s not AI that makes you unemployable, you do that to yourself.

As Cal Newport, the author of Deep Work, says: a craftsman should mindfully choose the tools he uses to craft his work. When you understand your tools, you can use them for your benefit and profit. AI can be powerful tool if used mindfully, it can help you grow. Used blindly, it can quietly hollow you out.

## Conclusion

I remember, as a child, participating in debates and writing essays on topics like “TV: Boon or Bane” or “Mobile Phones and the Internet: Blessing or Curse.” Now, maybe children today are writing essays on “AI: Boon or Bane.”

And I remember how I used to end those essays and debates every single time:

**_It’s you who decides whether you light a fire for cooking and warmth or to burn your own house._**
