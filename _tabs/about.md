### Hey there! I'm Swagatika
I truly believe in creating value through my work. In our increasingly tech-driven world, with smartphones at the center of everything from ordering food to connecting with loved ones, I realized something profound: what better way to impact countless lives than by building software products and services? This realization led me to dedicate myself to the vast world of software development. There's a unique sense of purpose and serenity that comes with having control over the products I create.

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me lost in a book or listening to one. I love diving into different genres, forgetting myself, and living through the characters. Being a part of their journeys, whether as an antagonist or protagonist, has really helped me develop empathy in the real world. I also enjoy learning from writers across various fields, from self-development and money management to spirituality, constantly seeking new insights to grow.
